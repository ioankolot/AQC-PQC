## Description
AQC-PQC is a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm that can run on near-term quantum devices. The algorithm starts by employing a parameterized quantum circuit and initializing the parameters so that they produce the ground state of a known Hamiltonian. Then, at each step, a small perturbation is added in the Hamiltonian and a (constained) system of linear equations is formed by calculating a series of observables on the unperturbed system. The solution of the (constrained) linear system is the shift vector that will translate the quantum mechanical system to the ground state of the perturbed system. By introducing perturbations at each step, the system iteratively hops between ground states so that at the end of the algorithm it will reach the ground state of the target Hamiltonian.

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Instructions

quantum_circuit.py -- This file constructs the parameterized quantum circuit. The single qubit gates, entanglement gates, layers and connectivity should change from main.py.

hamiltonian.py -- This file constructs the 2^n x 2^n (n=Number of Qubits) representation of the Hamiltonian. The implementation includes the Hamiltonian for the MaxCut and Number Partitioning problems (classical combinatorial optimization problems) and the Transverse-Field Ising Chain Model (quantum spin-configuration problem).

aqc_qpc.py -- This file contains the implementation of the AQC-PQC algorithm. 

main.py -- This file executes the AQC-PQC algorithm. Circuit architecture, type of problem, instance, #steps should all change from this file.

aqc_qaoa.py -- This file contains the implementation of the AQC-PQC algorithm when the QAOA ansatz is used.

qaoa_circuit.py -- This file contains the quantum circuit for the QAOA ansatz.

brute_force.py -- This file calculates the optimal energy and optimal solutions for any problem tackled (by brute force).
